# HardHat [ for Win+Mac ]

I don't like repetitive tasks and make a build is one of them... yuck!

**HardHat** was created to simplify and automate tasks related to Android development.

Previously had create the same app making a [Batch (for Windows)](https://github.com/equiman/hardhatwin/) and a [Bash (for macOS)](https://github.com/equiman/hardhatmac/) scripts to make the task, maintain both of them is a hard task to do, but now with .Net Core can use and share the same code on both Operating Systems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install?

* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (to Minify and Uglify)
* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [.Net Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/runtime) (optional)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (with NPM)

### Installing

Follow this steps to install on your local machine

Clone **HardHat** from GitHub on *recommended* path. Using this command on terminal:

| OS | Command |
| --- | --- |
| win | `git clone https://github.com/equiman/hardhat.git "D:\Applications\HardHat"` |
| mac | `git clone https://github.com/equiman/hardhat.git ~/Applications/HardHat/` |

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are, in short, variables that describe the environment in which programs run in.

Please verify that you have been configured all correctly. Paths in descriptions are examples (recommended) but use your own paths.

### Environment for Windows

| var | description |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_HOME` | D:\Applications\Android\SDK |
| `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` | %ANDROID_HOME%\ndk-bundle |
| `ANDROID_BT_VERSION` | 26.0.1 |
| `ANDROID_TEMPLATE` | D:\Applications\Android\Studio |
| `CODE_HOME` | C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code |
| `GIT_HOME` | C:\Program Files\Git |
| `GRADLE_HOME` | D:\Applications\Android\Gradle |
| `GULP_PROJECT` | D:\Applications\Gulp |
| `JAVA_HOME` | C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_74 |
| `NPM_HOME` | C:\Users\\`user`\AppData\Roaming\npm |
| `VPN_HOME` | C:\Program Files (x86)\CheckPoint\Endpoint Connect |
| `PATH` | %ANDROID_HOME%\build-tools\\%ANDROID_BT_VERSION%;<br>%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools;<br>%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;<br>%CODE_HOME%\bin;<br>%GIT_HOME%\cmd;<br>%GRADLE_HOME%\bin;<br>%NPM_HOME%;<br>C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;<br>C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\; |

Replace `user` with your windows user name and `ANDROID_BT_VERSION` with your Android SDK Build Tool version (recommended use the last one).

> **Where are environment variables?**  
> In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables button near the bottom of that tab. In the Environment Variables window, highlight the Path variable in the "System variables" section and click the Edit button.

### Environment for macOS

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="/usr/local/opt/android-sdk/"
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="/usr/local/opt/android-sdk/ndk-bundle"
export ANDROID_BT_VERSION="25.0.3"
export ANDROID_TEMPLATE="~/Applications/Android/Studio"
export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)"
export GULP_PROJECT="~/Applications/Gulp"
export VPN_HOME="/Applications/CheckPoint/Endpoint Connect"

export PATH="/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/$ANDROID_BT_VERSION:$PATH"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH"
export PATH="$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/:$PATH"
```

> **Where are environment variables?**  
> First, one thing to recognize about OS X is that it is built on Unix. This is where the .bash_profile comes in. When you start the Terminal app in OS X you get a bash shell by default. The bash shell comes from Unix and when it loads it runs the .bash_profile script. You can modify this script for your user to change your settings. This file is located at: `~/.bash_profile`

## Usage

Choose desired letter combination and let **HardHat** work for you. No more tedious and repetitive tasks stealing your precious time.

### Permissions

Before run **HardHat** macOS users need add execute permission to:
`chmod +x mac.sh`, `chmod +x mac.command` and `chmod +x dist/cmd.mac.sh`

### Run

In order to run **HardHat** open a terminal and run this command:

| OS | Path | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| win | `"D:\Applications\HardHat"` | `win.bat` |
| mac | `~/Applications/HardHat/` | `sh mac.sh` |

### Start Menu Icon

It's not mandatory but it's highly recommend create and Start Menu icon.

#### Star Menu for Windows

Use this commands on terminal (as Admin) to add an icon on your start menu:

```dos
:: Make Dir
md "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Android"
:: Copy Shortcut
cd /d "D:\Applications\HardHat\"
xcopy "HardHat.lnk" "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Android"
```

Open **star menu** and over the Android section you will can see the link. Remember mark with 'pin to start' option if you are using Win10.

#### Star Menu for macOS

Select `mac.command` file, then choose `File > Make Alias` or press `Command-L` and name it as **HardHat**.

Copy the picture in `icon.png` file  to the Clipboard.

One way to do this is to open the picture in Preview, choose `Edit > Select All`, then choose `Edit > Copy` or press `Command-C`.

Select **HardHat** (alias shortcut) file, then choose `File > Get Info`. At the top of the Info window, click the picture of the icon to select it, then choose `Edit > Paste` or press `Command-V`.

Just drag and drop **HardHat** (alias shortcut) to your Dock or Desktop.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

> **UPPERCASE** options means default choice in a question, feel free to continue quickly with <kbd>RETURN</kbd> key :wink:
